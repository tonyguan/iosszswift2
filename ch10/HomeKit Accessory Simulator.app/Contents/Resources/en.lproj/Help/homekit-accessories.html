    <p>To add an IP accessory to HomeKit Accessory Simulator, select the "+" located in the lower-left corner of the app and select "New Accessory..."; use the keyboard shortcut âŒ˜N; or from the File Menu, select "Accessory..." under the "New" menu item. Enter the accessory information when prompted and select the "Finish" button.</p>

    <p>To add a bridge to HomeKit Accessory Simulator, select the "+" located in the lower-left corner of the app and select "New Bridge..."; or from the File Menu, select "Bridge..." under the "New" menu item. Enter the bridge information when prompted and select the "Finish" button.</p>

    <p>To add a bridged accessory to a bridge, first select the bridge from the accessory list on the left side of the window. Make sure the "Accessories" view, not the "Services" view, is selected. Then, select the "Add Accessory" button in the main view on the right side of the window. Enter the bridged accessory information when prompted and select the "Finish" button.</p>
