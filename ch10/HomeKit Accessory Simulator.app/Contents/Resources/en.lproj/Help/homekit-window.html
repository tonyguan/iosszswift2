    <h1><img src="icon32x32.png" height="32" width="32" alt="Icon" /> The HomeKit Accessory Simulator Window</h1>

    <p>The HomeKit Accessory Simulator window is divided into two sections. The left side contains the accessory list which contains the Bluetooth LE accessory, IP accessories, bridges, and bridged accessories. The right side contains the main view and gives detailed information for the selected item.</p>

    <p>The accessory list displays the accessory name, whether the accessory is on or off, and if the accessory is identifying itself. When an accessory is on, there will be a blue dot next to the name. There is no dot when the accessory is off. When the accessory is identifying, the blue dot will blink for as long as the accessory is identifying. The accessory list also contains an interface for adding a new bridge or accessory.</p>

    <p>When selecting an accessory, the main view displays detailed information about every service and characteristic and provides an interface to change the values. It also provides an interface to add a service or to add a characteristic to an existing service. When selecting an accessory (that is not a bridged accessory) there is also an On/Off button in the top right which toggles whether or not the accessory is active and reachable.</p>

    <p>When selecting a bridge, the main view displays either information about the bridged accessories, or information about the bridge itself. When the "Accessories" view is active, information about the bridged accessories and their services and characteristics is shown. The "Accessories" view also provides an interface for adding and removing bridged accessories. The "Services" view shows information about the bridge itself, and allows adding services and characteristics to the bridge. There is also an On/Off button in the top right which toggles whether or not the bridge and all of its bridged accessories are active and reachable.</p>
