    <p>To add a characteristic to a service, select the accessory, bridge, or bridged accessory that contains the service from the list on the left side of the window. Once the item is selected, it's services are visible in the main view on the right side of the window. If a bridge was selected, be sure the "Services" view, not the "Accessories" view, is active. Each service has it's own "Add Characteristic" button. Select the "Add Characteristic" button of the service for which the characteristic is to be added.</p>

    <p>This will bring up the options for the new characteristic. There is an option to create a custom characteristic type as well as to create one of the Apple defined characteristics.</p>

    <p>If a custom characteristic is chosen, a valid UUID must be entered. The format, units, and read/write properties can also be chosen. If a numeric format is selected, the minimum value, maximum value, and step value can be specified. If the string format is selected, the maximum string length can be specified.</p>

    <p>Once the characteristic details are completed, select the "Finish" button to add the characteristic.</p>
