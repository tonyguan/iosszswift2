    <p>To add a service to an accessory or bridged accessory, display the service list by selecting the accessory or bridged accessory from the list on the left side of the window. To add a service to a bridge, display the service list by selecting the bridge from the list on the left side of the window, and then select the "Services" view. Then from the service list, add a new service by selecting the "Add Service" button.</p>

    <p>This will bring up the options for the new service. There is an option to create a custom service type as well as to create one of the Apple defined services.</p>

    <p>A service can either be a primary service or a secondary service. A secondary service must be associated with a primary service, so the primary service must be created first.</p>

    <p>Once the service details are completed, select the "Finish" button to add the service.</p>
