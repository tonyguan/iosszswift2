    <p>Once an accessory or bridge has been created, and is turned On, it can be discovered by the iOS device via the HomeKit API. Once the accessory or bridge has been selected, a prompt will appear on the iOS device to enter the accessory's Setup Code. Note that for bridges, the pairing process happens with the bridge and not with the bridged accessories. To view the Setup Code, select the accessory or bridge from the accessory list on the left side of the window. The Setup Code is at the top of the window, below the accessory or bridge name.</p>

    <p>An accessory or bridge only needs to be paired to a device once. After the initial pairing process, the device will reconnect to the accessory or bridge when it is reachable and will not require a Setup Code again.</p>

    <p>The number of devices paired with the accessory or bridge is shown at the top of the right side of the window. To reset the pairings, select the "Reset" button.</p>
